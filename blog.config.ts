    `I'm a Vim enthusiast and tab advocate, finding unmatched efficiency in
    Vim's keystroke commands and tabs' flexibility for personal viewing
    preferences. This extends to my support for static typing, where its
    early error detection ensures cleaner code, and my preference for dark
    mode, which eases long coding sessions by reducing eye strain.`
